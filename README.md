Tell your friend a story
===
Comfort your friend by telling them a story. Preferable a long one. Everyone knows long plaintext storiest are the best kind of stories. Reads shakespeare.txt and calls the Win32API to send keyboard events to type out the entire works of Shakespeare.

Usage
---
The script will basically render your keyboard useless, so I suggest you preemptively prepare an End Process? dialog on python.exe through Task Manager.
Run ```python xiaonan.py```.
